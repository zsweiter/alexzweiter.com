# ✨ My Portfolio Website

Hey! This is the source code behind my personal corner of the web: **[alexzweiter.com](https://alexzweiter.com)**. It’s an experiment in blending **Astro’s** speed with the immersive world of **Three.js**.

---

### 🚀 The Stack

-   **Astro:** For that lightning-fast, static-first foundation.
-   **Three.js:** Powering the 3D visuals and WebGL magic.
-   **TypeScript:** Keeping the codebase clean and predictable.
